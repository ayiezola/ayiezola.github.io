# Introduction

Last year, we heard about scammers actively attacking Malaysians through Telegram Takeovers. Based on previous attack patterns, perpetrators used phishing links to lure victims into entering their Telegram credentials. Then, within a few seconds, the perpetrators attempted to take over the victims' Telegram accounts using the information they obtained. Nowadays, the threat actors have changed their method by using Android Package Kits (APKs) with the same objective. This incident has been reported by the Malaysian news portal [Harian Metro](https://www.hmetro.com.my/mutakhir/2024/06/1096977/waspada-mesej-jemputan-kahwin-digital-guna-fail-apk).

# Technical Summary

To spy on SMS, phone call logs, and access victims' contacts, threat actors need to plant their malicious APK on the victim's device. Once successfully installed, the APK will establish a process called 'Surat Jemputan' that continuously runs, monitoring any SMS and call logs received by the victim. It then forwards this information to Command and Control (C2) with the objective of taking over the victim's Telegram or WhatsApp account, as well as accessing their contacts. This objective will only be achieved if the victim successfully installs the malicious APK. 

# How threat actors distributed the malware

</p>

We can see that the chain of this attack involves threat actors using Social Engineering (SE) techniques to spread the malicious APK. Threat actors or scammers spread their malicious APK through the victim's contacts based on previous compromises. Some victims have received a message containing "Jemputan Majlis Perkahwinan" with an APK attachment named MAJELIS_JEMPUTAN.apk. The message content also instructs the victim to install the APK to see the event details. At this point, the victim believes the invitation is valid because it comes from their contact and is keen to know the important date and details of the event.

### Application Behavior

### Permision Abuse

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-abuse-permision.png" width="" height="" >

From the picture above, we can see that this APK file requires five dangerous malware permissions to function properly. One of the interesting aspects is the permissions WAKE_LOCK and RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED. These permissions allow the malicious APK to execute commands before the device goes to sleep and after the device has completely booted, respectively.

### Manifest File

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-manifest.png" width="" height="" >

The AndroidManifest file is a root element for an Android application. If we look at the picture above, it provides us with initial information about the application's permissions, version, and package name. For this malicious APK, there are 10 abnormal permission requests during the installation process.

### Application Package

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-package.png" width="" height="" ></p>

The package name for this malicious APK is Whatsbulk. In the picture above, we can see there are 10 Java files under the Whatsbulk folder. Yes of course, we will explore the behavior of the Java code.

## Malicious capabilities

### Get device information

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-getdevice-info.png" width="" height="" >

Look at picture above, at the first code block, this application attempts to request the permision declare in AndroidManifest file.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-check-phone.png" width="" height="" >

This code will manage SMS content string or SMS format about device specific information in order to send message to attacker C2 by using telegram API.

### Get Battery Status, SIM Information & IMSI

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-getbattery-status.png" width="" height="" >

At this point, we can see from the code above that the application will gather information about the device's battery status if it has the permission READ_PHONE_STATE. It also checks for the SIM slot value and extracts the phone number. All this information will be sent to the attackerâ€™s C2 server for target information collection, similar to logging.

### Monitor SMS

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-monitor-sms.png" width="" height="" >

The code above is designed to monitor incoming SMS messages received by victims. We know that scammers are particularly interested in waiting for OTP codes to proceed with further malicious actions.

The first code block under the function SMSMonitor extracts SMS data messages and initializes an array of SmsMessage objects.

The second code block combines all the strings to form a complete text message.

The third code block retrieves the sender's phone number and the subscription ID from the extras.

The final code block prepares the input data and requests the network connectivity status, indicating whether the device is CONNECTED.

### Monitor Call

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-monitor-call.png" width="" height="" >

This code monitors the caller's phone number and checks if the call is not ringing or if the caller's phone number is NULL; it will do nothing. Additionally, it checks the Subscription ID to determine which SIM slot is being used. All this information is then queued to be sent to the attacker's C2 server.

### Successfully Install & Notify Attacker

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-notify-infection.png" width="" height="" >

Code above will check if the next button is clicked, then update MainActivity with victim phone number. Call SendIntro to execute notification to attacker. Start MainActivity then mark first setup has complete.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-firstsetup-notify.png" width="" height="" >

Function above will notify attacker after first setup has been successfully install in victim device. Attacker will be notify right after this process has been done using telegram API.

### Anti VM

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-installed.png" width="300" height="600" > <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-app-approach.png" width="300" height="600" ></p>

During the installation process, we noticed that this application will prompt a window for each permission request. These include permissions to access phone call logs, contacts, manage phone calls, and view/send messages. It's crucial to be aware of all these permission requests from any APK we attempt to install. These permissions represent top malware risks that can compromise our security and privacy.

### Enter Phone Number

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-enter-phone-no.png" width="300" height="600" ></p>p

Once successfully installed, a popup window appeared prompting us to enter our phone number. We decided to use a temporary phone number just to understand how this attack flow progresses.

### Received OTP

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-02.png" width="300" height="600" ></p>p

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-03.jpeg" width="250" height="250" ></p>

A few minutes later, we observed that our testing phone received an OTP code for WhatsApp registration. A message window popped up indicating that a WhatsApp registration code had been requested. Additionally, we received an SMS containing the OTP code for WhatsApp registration on a new device.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-shopeepay.jpeg" width="250" height="250" ></p>

Based on this analysis, we decided to replicate this APK and set up our own C2 using the Telegram Bot API. To make it operational, we set up a new Telegram bot, obtained a Telegram API key, and identified a Telegram Chat ID. Once everything was set up and ready, we proceeded to install the APK on a testing phone. We successfully sent SMS messages and made calls through the testing device.

### Received Notification

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayiezola/ayiezola.github.io/master/assets/scammer/app-scam-replicate-01.png" width="" height="" ></p>
